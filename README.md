## Introduction
A common goal of cloud computing is to abstract away operational tasks from applications so that
developer efforts can be focused on providing business value. One feature common to most applications is the need to
monitor application and hardware metrics. On
[Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/) the [Stackdriver](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/) suite
of products addresses the need for monitoring and alerting. Some companies may already have a third party solution, however, and this project demonstrates configuring the use of [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) in a [Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) environment. We show you how to collect [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) metrics and pipe them to your existing Datadog account.

This demo contains a simple deployment script for Kubernetes Engine using personal accounts and Terraform. There is one manifest
that deploys the Datadog agents and nginx.

NOTE: Personal account should never be used in a CI/CD
pipeline. Provision a service account with all permissions needed to run this when automated.

## Architecture
There is a single Kubernetes Engine cluster with 2 nodes. The `datadog-agent.yaml` manifest creates a [DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/) that runs the Datadog agent on
each node in the cluster. Alongside the Datadog agents are nginx processes that feed metrics to Datadog.

## Prerequisites

A Google Cloud account and project is required for this.  Access to an existing Google Cloud
project with the Kubernetes Engine service enabled If you do not have a Google Cloud account
please signup for a free trial [here](https://cloud.google.com).

### Run Demo in a Google Cloud Shell

Click the button below to run the demo in a [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/).

[![Open in Cloud Shell](http://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.svg)](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?git_repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FGoogleCloudPlatform%2Fgke-rolling-updates-demo&page=editor&tutorial=in-place-rolling-upgrade%2FREADME.md&image=gcr.io/graphite-cloud-shell-images/terraform)

This Cloud Shell uses a custom container to install terraform, please select the 'Trust' radio button to
start the custom container when the Cloud Shell starts.

All the tools for the demo are installed. When your shell starts execute the following
command in order to setup gcloud cli.

```console
gcloud init
```

### Supported Operating Systems

This project will run on macOS, Linux, or in a [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/).

### Tools

The following tools are required. When using Cloud Shell the tools are already installed.

* Google Cloud SDK 204.0.0
* Kubectl v1.10.0
* Terraform v0.11.3
* Apache Bench

The specific versions used may not be absolutely required but if you run into issues this may help.

#### Install Cloud SDK
The Google Cloud SDK is used to interact with your GCP resources.
[Installation instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads) for multiple platforms are available online.

#### Install kubectl CLI

The kubectl CLI is used to interteract with both Kubernetes Engine and kubernetes in general.
[Installation instructions](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart)
for multiple platforms are available online.

#### Install Terraform

Terraform is used to automate the manipulation of cloud infrastructure. Its
[installation instructions](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html) are also available online.

#### Install Apache Bench

For many users this won't be necessary as many operating systems have Apache
Bench pre-installed. However it is contained within the `apache2-utils` package
for Ubuntu/Debian users, and the `httpd-tools` package for CentOS/Redhat users.

#### Configure Authentication

Use `gcloud auth login <your.account@example.com> --no-launch-browser` to get a link to log in your
gcloud cli to your personal account.

## Deployment

### Set up Datadog
1. Create a [free account](https://www.datadoghq.com/pricing/) on Datadog or use an existing one.
1. Login to the DatadogHQ site and go to [Agent Installation](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent/kubernetes) to display the text for the Datadog agent Kubernetes manifest. Scroll down until you see `DD_API_KEY`. Copy the value and paste it into `manifests/datadog-agent.yaml` at the same key.
1. In DatadogHQ site go to "Integrations" -> Type "nginx" in the search bar -> Click on the "NGINX" Tile -> "Configuration" Tab -> "Install Integration" -- NGINX dashboards will now be available in the "Dashboards List"

### Set up Kubernetes Engine Cluster Using Terraform
1. Run: `gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com` - This allows for programmatic access to Kubernetes Engine, which will be used by scripts run at the commandline.
1. Run: `./scripts/generate-tfvars.sh` - This uses values from your gcloud configuration and saves them to a configuration file that Terraform uses to deploy the demo to the configured project and zone.
1. Run: `cd terraform` - This puts you in the directory with Terraform's configuration files.
1. Run: `terraform init` - This prepares Terraform for action by downloading dependencies used to access GCP.
1. Run: `terraform plan` - This is optional, but recommended as it displays a list of changes Terraform will make to your infrastructure.
1. Run `terraform apply` - This runs the infrastructure automation to create your Kubernetes Engine cluster and prepare it for use.
1. Type `yes` when prompted
1. Allow the deploy to finish

### Deploy Services

1. Run: `cd ..` - This puts you back at your project root.
1. Run: `kubectl create configmap nginx-config --from-file=manifests/configs/default.conf` - This loads the nginx configuration into Kubernetes as a [ConfigMap](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/configmap).
1. Run: `kubectl create configmap datadog-config --from-file=manifests/configs/conf.yaml` - This loads the Datadog configuration into Kubernetes as a ConfigMap.
1. Run: `kubectl apply -f manifests/` - This deploys the Datadog agent and nginx to your Kubernetes Engine cluster. It may take a minute or two and will complete in the background.


## Validation

1. Log into your Datadog account.
1. Go to the [Dashboards page](https://app.datadoghq.com/dashboard/lists).
1. You will see two pre-built Nginx dashboards that contain metrics for the nginx containers.
1. Click on **NGINX - Metrics**.
1. From a terminal execute ```EXT_IP=http://$(kubectl get svc nginx -n default -ojsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}/'); echo $EXT_IP```. - If it displays a valid url with an IP address the service is deployed and ready to use. You can access the provided address in a browser to verify that nginx is handling requests.
1. Run ```ab -n 1000 $EXT_IP``` - This will run a load test against nginx and generate metrics that will be forwarded to Datadog.
1. In a few moments you should see data coming into your Datadog dashboard.


## Tear Down
Run `cd terraform` to get back to the Terraform directory and run `terraform destroy` to remove all resources created by this demo.


## Troubleshooting

** No data is displaying in Datadog **
 * Make sure you grabbed the `DD_API_KEY` value from the generated datadog-agent.yaml from the Datadog site. It is generated for you for your specific account.

** Terraform fails due to issues with zone or project **
 * Make sure your gcloud config has values for core/project and compute/zone.
 ```
 gcloud config set core/project <YOUR PROJECT>
 gcloud config set compute/zone <THE ZONE YOU WANT>
 ```

** The install script fails with a `Permission denied` when running Terraform **
 * The credentials that Terraform is using do not provide the
necessary permissions to create resources in the selected projects. Ensure
that the account listed in `gcloud config list` has necessary permissions to
create resources. If it does, regenerate the application default credentials
using `gcloud auth application-default login`.
